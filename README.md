    When coming up with the idea for the hackathon we wanted to solve real issues that people face on a day to day basis. It was important for us to make impactful changes that would either save the user time and money. That is why our App consisted of two key topics, Automated Climate control and Adaptive charging. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1) Automated Climate Control
    The purpose of this feature was to have a way to automate the climate when the car is either too hot or too cold. That you are always entering your car at an ideal temperature. This feature can help with not only comfort but also with time. We can truly see this as an essential factor in two scenarios. The first scenario is when the car is too cold. With our app the user is able to remotely adjust the temperature, turn the rear and front defrosters on all within the app. That way the user is able to get into the car almost seamlessly, without having to wait for precious time waiting for the car to heat up. The second scenario is that the car is seletring hot to the point that it is unbearable to be inside of. With the app, the user is able to cool down the car to a comfortable temperature and is able to do something else while the car cools down. Once the car cools down the user is able to enjoy the car ride without any sort of initial discomfort.
    In our app design we tried to make it such that the user has as many viable options to adjust the temperature to his liking. We used the carâ€™s internal temperature reader to display the current temperature inside and outside the car. That way the user can make an informed decision on what temperature he wants his car to be. We have incorporated a slider that is able to set to a specific temperature and can either set the temperature in either celsius or degrees. Once the user confirms the desired temperature, the user will be updated in real time about the car's internal temperature and will be notified once the car reaches the desired temperature. We have also given the option to turn on the front and rear defrosters when the temperature outside is too cold.
    This feature would be ideal for people who know their daily schedule and use their cars in extreme temperatures where it's always either too hot or cold.

2) Adaptive Charging
    The purpose of this feature was to make the battery only charge when the energy cost in that is at its off peaks. In the power grid there are times where energy costs more and because of that will charge the users extra using it during those times. Therefore by analyzing when the peak hours are, the algorithm would decide when to charge and not charge when a certain battery threshold is met. This would save the user a lot of money in the long run by only charging at these off peak times. 
    In our app design we created it in such a way that gives the user an option if they want the battery to charge at those peak times. If they opt in the battery will stop charging at those peaks and will only start charging when an off peak time occurs. This adaptive charging will only take place if there is a minimum battery threshold of at least 30%. That way the user has some battery in their car if they truly need to go somewhere in an emergency.
    This feature is ideal for most consumers as it will save the consumers a lot of money in the long run.
